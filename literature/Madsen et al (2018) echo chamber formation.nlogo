# Concept

A rational account of why some people may end up believing Obama is a Lizard man.

# Overview
Agents form priors from a distribution. They then search out other users based on given rules (reach, confirmatory suitability). Agents form a network with those of acceptable beliefs, and update their own beliefs appropriately. Agents will also then prune their existing networks based on aformentioned suitability. The simulation ends when all agents P(H|E) = 1 (i.e. they are now entirely confident that their version of the world is the true one).

## General Setup
Agents (users) are randomly populated onto a fixed 2d plane.
These agents are all encoded with a bayesian learning model (see "Update Algorithm" below), and generate a prior regarding the state of the world (termed a "Belief-state" but represents the different possible hypotheses - see "Prior Formation (Setup)" below).
The number of users, and the dimensions of the 2d plane may be manipulatedby the modeller. Though it should be noted that "reach" functionality (see "Search Algorithm") is based on Euclidean distance, and thus variance in the density (users per pixel) is likely to impact model results.

**New in this (Version 9) Model**
Functionality now included for all agent's to be spoken to by a "broadcaster".
The value this broadcaster wishes to communicate is controlled by slider "broadcast-val". The frequency of these broadcasts is controlled by "broadcast-freq", where 0 = no broadcasts, 1 = broadcasts every ticks, and 10 = broadcasts every 10 ticks.

Note: In the present version, when agents recieve a broadcast (see "to receive-broadcast" function), the value is automatically added to their distribution (i.e. history), and they update P(H|E) in light of this value. In other words, for the broadcasting ticks, agents are not searching, nor are they randomly selecting a value to update with, based on their established network.

For assessing the impact of these broadcasts, I have added a subset of agents to the key graphs (labelled "Extremists", in red). Whom belongs to this subset is dictated by the slider "extremist-SD", where higher values multiply the distance from the population mean (in SDs) needed to be classified an extremist. This subgroup was added, as taking an overall assessment of agents swallows the potential (desired) impact of broadcasts, given that the majority of agents are perfectly comfortable with broadcasts of 0.5.


## Prior Formation (Setup)
Agents are exposed to evidence which then informs their starting belief-state.
The number of peices of evidence the agents see is manipulated using the "prior-sample-size" slider.
This evidence is generated from a normal distribution (mean = 0.5, SD = manipulated using "Prior-sd" slider; typically .25). Evidence is capped {0,1}, in .01 increments. E.g. An agent exposed to three peices of evidence might be [.34,.78,.45].
Agents store each peice of evidence, forming a distribution. The mean of this distribution is the agent's starting belief-state. The standard deviation of this distribution is used to inform the search algorithm (see below).
In this way, the more evidence agents are exposed to, the more agents will conform according to central limit theorem.

## Scale-Free Setup (and references)

Agent setup follows a scale free network structure.

This is manipulated via SF-setup-YN, and the density of the scale free network is manipulated via the factor SF-density-mod. Recommended value is 2.5.
When turned off, agents are distributed randomly.
When turned on, agents are distributed via the scale free setup (links are severed at the end of the process, leaving only the scale free positioning). Run process remains the same in both cases.

# Run Procedure
The following procedures (search, update, and prune) are run for all agents once per tick, until the agent reaches a P(H|E) of 1. The simulation ends when all agents reach a P(H|E) of 1.
## Search Algorithm
The distance (physical) agents can search for evidence (i.e. other users) is manipulated using the "search-distance" slider, and is hereafter termed "reach".
Each agent uses their history (distribution) to inform their belief-state (mean) and variance around the belief-state (standard deviation).
This interval (+/- SD around the mean) may then be either widened or narrowed using the "prune-sd-mod" slider.
The interval is used in confirmatory search (this process can be turned off using "con-search-YN" switch, resulting in a stochastic search based solely off reach).
Agents within reach are then subseted into those who possess a belief-state within the accepted range. [Can add rationale behind assumption here.]
Of this subset, the agent selects one agent (selected randomly; and can include a perviously selected agent [Insert rationale behind assumption here.]
The agent then forms a link with this agent.
As agents become more convinced they possess the correct belief-state (I.e. as P(H|E) increases), the likelihood of searching decreases. [Rationale here.]

**Agents who fail to find acceptable candidates**
Those who cannot find a suitable candidate within their reach have their distribution widened (.01 and .99 peices of evidence are added to their distribution). This artificial widening...
P(H|E) is not updated when this happens, as penalization (i.e. reduction in P(H|E) will occur when they are subsequently exposed to the "new" (previously unacceptable) evidence).
Agents who fail to find suitable agents (and thus possess no network connections) are precluded from both updating and pruning alogithms for that time point.

## Update Algorithm
Of an agent's visible network (i.e. those who they are directly connected with), the agent randomly selects *one* of the agents, and samples it's belief-state.
This belief-state sample (or "evidence") is then added to the agent's own distribution, and the new mean (belief-state) is calculated, along with the updated standard deviation (for pruning / search).

P(H|E) Update:
Critically, the new peice of evidence is evaluated using Bayes Theorem to update P(H|E) as follows:
P(H|E) = (P(E|H).P(H))/(P(E)
where P(H) is the agents prior, and the likelihood ratio is calculated using two normal distribution (probability density) curves, as follows:

P(E) = (1 / (prior-sd * sqrt(2 * pi))) * e ^ (-((new-E - True-Mean)^ 2) / (2 * (prior-sd ^ 2)))
Where new-E is the new peice of evidence, prior-sd is the *true distribution standard deviation* and True-mean is the *true distribution mean*. This yields the probability of that evidence occuring irrespective of an agent's particular belief-state (Hypothesis).

P(E|H) = (1 / (own-sd * sqrt(2 * pi))) * e ^ (-((new-E - own-mean)^ 2) / (2 * (own-sd ^ 2)))
Where new-E is the new peice of evidence, own-sd is the *standard deviation of the agent's belief-state distribution* and own-mean is the *mean of the agent's belief-state distribution*. This yields the probability of that evidence occuring given the agent's particular belief-state (Hypothesis).

In this way, if the evidence is more likely given the agent's hypothesis, the likelihood ratio is >1 and P(H|E) increases. Or if the evidence is less likely given the agent's hypothesis, the likelihood ratio is <1 and P(H|E) decreases.

## Pruning Algorithm
Once the update phase is completed, agents move into the pruning phase.
Agents use the same suitablility range as used in search, but on their pre-existing network.
If an agent on their direct network has a belief-state that now lies outside of the acceptable range given the update procedure, this connection is severed. Agents sever all unacceptable links each pruning phase.

# Diseminator Agents (Anti-confirming; AC-Agents)

Manipulated percentage of agents who seek out contrary beliefs (i.e. the inverse of the confirmatory search function).
Percentage of agents of this type is manipulated via AC-Prcnt.
Degree of search (narrowness of interval for agents considered similar, then used to find the inverse - agents outside of this similarity band) is manipulated via AC-search-SD.

# Behaviours of Interest

## Distribution of Beliefs over Time
How the distribution of belief states changes over time. Notably how much they converge, and inversely how well extremist belief-states are maintained.

## Purity of Networks over Time
Taken as the mean distance of a user from those in their direct network. The lower the number the "purer" each user's network becomes (i.e. less and less disparate belief states among users).

## P(H|E) over Time
How the global (or agent) level of P(H|E) changes over time. Expected to increase, but may have percolation points...

# Recommendations

1. Turning on or off confirmatory search
2. Restricting or Maximising pruning/search acceptability
3. Reducing / Increasing physical reach of agents

# Model Extensions

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)
